">> have questions not directly addressed in the text of the lesson.\n"
">> * It can be hard for learners to listen and type at the same time, due to the  \n"
">> *split-attention effect* we\n"
">> [discussed earlier]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/05-memory.md %}#why-guided-practice-is-important).\n"

Don't do this, since there is a fair chance you'll run into something unexpected that you then have to explain.

">\n"

">\n"
">> ## Recommendations\n"
">>\n"
">> If you and a partner are co-teaching, try to follow these recommendations:\n"
">>\n"
">>- Coordinate who is teaching what, sufficiently in advance that\n"
">>  both instructors are confident in their preparation.\n"
">>\n"
">>- If you have time to do some\n"
">>  advance preparation together, try drawing a concept map together or\n"
">>  teaching a short snippet of the lessons for each other.\n"
">>\n"
">>- Discuss in advance if you will providing feedback to each other\n"
">>  and how to do so (see notes above).\n"
">>\n"
">>- If it won't cause cognitive overload for you (the instructors),\n"
">>  work out a couple of hand signals to communicate.  \"You're\n"
">>  going too fast\", \"speak up\", \"that learner needs help\", and, \"It's\n"
">>  time for a bathroom break\" are all useful.\n"
">>\n"
">>- The person who isn't teaching shouldn't interrupt, offer\n"
">>  corrections, elaborations, or amusing personal anecdotes, or do\n"
">>  anything else to distract from what the person teaching at the time\n"
">>  is doing or saying.  The one exception is that it's sometimes\n"
">>  helpful to ask leading questions, particularly if the learners seem\n"
">>  unsure of themselves.\n"
">>\n"
">>- For Carpentries workshops, a single instructor usually teaches for a\n"
">>  half-day stretch (2-3 hours).  You can alternate more frequently, but\n"
">>  each person should teach for at least 10-15 minutes at a stretch,\n"
">>  since learners may be distracted by more frequent interleaving.\n"
">>\n"
">>- Each person should take a couple of minutes before they start\n"
">>  teaching to see what their partner is going to teach after they're\n"
">>  done.  This allows each instructor to set up their partner's material\n"
">>  without covering it themselves.\n"
">>\n"
">>- Whenever possible, the person who isn't teaching should stay engaged\n"
">>  with the class.  Monitor the shared notes, keep an eye\n"
">>  on the learners to see who's struggling, jot down some feedback to\n"
">>  give your teaching partner at the next break - anything that\n"
">>  contributes to the lesson is better than anything that doesn't.  It's\n"
">>  easier for the other instructor to take a break to catch up on outside\n"

"  they are not talking.  You may need to repeat this a few times during the early part\n"
"  of the training, until people are doing it consistently.  \n"
"  - In general, it works best to have everyone use zoom individually on their computers\n"
"  (so you can see everyone's faces); for trainings where some of the participants are\n"
"  co-located, have them use their own computer for video but pick one person to use\n"
"  for mic/sound.  \n"
"  - “Gallery view” in the upper right toggles the display to show more participants' videos.  \n"
"  - “Share screen” is at the bottom middle of the screen. To end “share screen”, click the red button that will appear at the top middle of the screen when you are in screen sharing mode.  \n"
"  - When you screen share, you have the option to share individual apps or your entire desktop. The default is the full desktop.\n"
"  - The Zoom chat is not stable (it is not saved across sessions or after going into breakout rooms, and people who have just joined a room can't see previously posted chat items). We highly recommend using the Etherpad or Google Doc chat instead. For those who want to save the chat, they do that using the \"More\" option in the chat window, which offers \"Save chat\". Choosing this will save the chat to a local text file on the person's computer.\n"
"  - During breaks, learners will often turn off their video and wait for your audio cue to re-activate. This makes it look like no one is back from break, but just saying 'hello' will generally get a bunch of people to come back on video quickly.\n"
"  - When several attendees are in the same room (member trainings): it is helpful to have every participant log in separately so that you can see names and faces and they can interact by waving or using the chat. However, it is important that only one microphone and speaker should be active in the room at one time or feedback and noise will be a problem. When creating breakouts, you can either leave these people in the main room or shuffle people around to create a room just for them. Either way, ask them to leave a mic on so you can listen in.\n"
"  - Attendees might like to have a separate room (without Trainers) to network in over lunch or other breaks. Be prepared to assign that room and then close it to restart the main session.\n"
"  - when you are in the Zoom meeting room but unintentionally not as the host, look for the button 'Claim host' (click on the 'Participants' button; you'll be asked for a 6-digit host key, which you can find (after logging in to [Zoom][zoom-home]), at the bottom of the profile, see [the explanation here][zoom-host-key]."

"ready to put your best foot forward in the classroom and we are here to help you do that. (KW)\n"
"* I will not tell anyone that they have passed or ask anyone to repeat during this session. That information will come in the follow up email. (KW)\n"

"from, that way you can keep your notes up on your screen without us seeing them. It's perfectly fine to teach using your\n"

"notes in the etherpad. If you do this, suggest having presenter give their own feedback, then other learners, then Trainer can\n"
