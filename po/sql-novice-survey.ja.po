"    The answers are:\n"
"    1.  Relational databases are far more widely used than NoSQL databases.\n"
"    2.  We have far more experience with relational databases than with any "
"other kind,\n"
"        so we have a better idea of what to teach and how to teach it.\n"
"    3.  NoSQL databases are as different from each other as they are from "
"relational databases.\n"
"        Until a leader emerges, it isn't clear *which* NoSQL database we "
"should teach."
