"# Contributing\n"
"\n"
"[Software Carpentry][swc-site] and [Data Carpentry][dc-site] are open source projects,\n"
"and we welcome contributions of all kinds:\n"
"new lessons,\n"
"fixes to existing material,\n"
"bug reports,\n"
"and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.\n"
"\n"
"## Contributor Agreement\n"
"\n"
"By contributing,\n"
"you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md).\n"
"In exchange,\n"
"we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can,\n"
"and help you become a member of our community.\n"
"Everyone involved in [Software Carpentry][swc-site] and [Data Carpentry][dc-site]\n"
"agrees to abide by our [code of conduct](CONDUCT.md).\n"
"\n"
"## How to Contribute\n"
"\n"
"The easiest way to get started is to file an issue\n"
"to tell us about a spelling mistake,\n"
"some awkward wording,\n"
"or a factual error.\n"
"This is a good way to introduce yourself\n"
"and to meet some of our community members.\n"
"\n"
"1.  If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account,\n"
"    you can [send us comments by email][contact].\n"
"    However,\n"
"    we will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other methods described below.\n"
"\n"
"2.  If you have a [GitHub][github] account,\n"
"    or are willing to [create one][github-join],\n"
"    but do not know how to use Git,\n"
"    you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues].\n"
"    This allows us to assign the item to someone\n"
"    and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.\n"
"\n"
"3.  If you are comfortable with Git,\n"
"    and would like to add or change material,\n"
"    you can submit a pull request (PR).\n"
"    Instructions for doing this are [included below](#using-github).\n"
"\n"
"## Where to Contribute\n"
"\n"
"1.  If you wish to change this lesson,\n"
"    please work in <https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-open-refine>,\n"
"    which can be viewed at <https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-open-refine/>.\n"
"\n"
"2.  If you wish to change the example lesson,\n"
"    please work in <https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example>,\n"
"    which documents the format of our lessons\n"
"    and can be viewed at <https://swcarpentry.github.io/lesson-example>.\n"
"\n"
"3.  If you wish to change the template used for workshop websites,\n"
"    please work in <https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template>.\n"
"    The home page of that repository explains how to set up workshop websites,\n"
"    while the extra pages in <https://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template>\n"
"    provide more background on our design choices.\n"
"\n"
"4.  If you wish to change CSS style files, tools,\n"
"    or HTML boilerplate for lessons or workshops stored in `_includes` or `_layouts`,\n"
"    please work in <https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles>.\n"
"\n"
"## What to Contribute\n"
"\n"
"There are many ways to contribute,\n"
"from writing new exercises and improving existing ones\n"
"to updating or filling in the documentation\n"
"and and submitting [bug reports][issues]\n"
"about things that don't work, aren't clear, or are missing.\n"
"If you are looking for ideas,\n"
"please see [the list of issues for this repository][issues],\n"
"or the issues for [Data Carpentry][dc-issues]\n"
"and [Software Carpentry][swc-issues] projects.\n"
"\n"
"Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome:\n"
"we are smarter together than we are on our own.\n"
"Reviews from novices and newcomers are particularly valuable:\n"
"it's easy for people who have been using these lessons for a while\n"
"to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be,\n"
"so fresh eyes are always welcome.\n"
"\n"
"## What *Not* to Contribute\n"
"\n"
"Our lessons already contain more material than we can cover in a typical workshop,\n"
"so we are usually *not* looking for more concepts or tools to add to them.\n"
"As a rule,\n"
"if you want to introduce a new idea,\n"
"you must (a) estimate how long it will take to teach\n"
"and (b) explain what you would take out to make room for it.\n"
"The first encourages contributors to be honest about requirements;\n"
"the second, to think hard about priorities.\n"
"\n"
"We are also not looking for exercises or other material that only run on one platform.\n"
"Our workshops typically contain a mixture of Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux users;\n"
"in order to be usable,\n"
"our lessons must run equally well on all three.\n"
"\n"
"## Using GitHub\n"
"\n"
"If you choose to contribute via GitHub,\n"
"you may want to look at\n"
"[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].\n"
"In brief:\n"
"\n"
"1.  The published copy of the lesson is in the `gh-pages` branch of the repository\n"
"    (so that GitHub will regenerate it automatically).\n"
"    Please create all branches from that,\n"
"    and merge the [master repository][repo]'s `gh-pages` branch into your `gh-pages` branch\n"
"    before starting work.\n"
"    Please do *not* work directly in your `gh-pages` branch,\n"
"    since that will make it difficult for you to work on other contributions.\n"
"\n"
"2.  We use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:\n"
"    1.  Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.\n"
"    2.  Commit the change in that branch.\n"
"    3.  Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.\n"
"    4.  Submit a pull request from that branch to the [master repository][repo].\n"
"    5.  If you receive feedback,\n"
"        make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub:\n"
"        the pull request will update automatically.\n"
"\n"
"Each lesson has two maintainers who review issues and pull requests\n"
"or encourage others to do so.\n"
"The maintainers are community volunteers,\n"
"and have final say over what gets merged into the lesson.\n"
"\n"
"## Other Resources\n"
"\n"
"General discussion of [Software Carpentry][swc-site] and [Data Carpentry][dc-site]\n"
"happens on the [discussion mailing list][discuss-list],\n"
"which everyone is welcome to join.\n"
"You can also [reach us by email][contact].\n"

">\n"
">In this case we are going to use the CrossRef API: [https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc)](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc). Read more about the CrossRef service: [http://www.crossref.org](http://www.crossref.org). Note that API providers may impose rate limits or have other requirements for using their data, so it's important to check the site's documentation. To comply with API rate limits, use the Throttle Delay setting to specify the number of milliseconds between URL requests. CrossRef, for instance, [asks users](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#etiquette) to \"specify a User-Agent header that properly identifies your script or tool and that provides a means of contacting you via email using 'mailto:'.\" User-agent headers provide administrators with user information that facilitates better administration and moderation of the API, and it is generally good etiquette to include a header with any API request.\n"
">\n"
">To edit your User-Agent header:\n"
">* Click 'Show' (next to 'HTTP headers to be used when fetching URLs'). Note that OpenRefine has already populated the 'User-Agent' field with information about the version of OpenRefine you are using; it should look similar to ```OpenRefine 3.2 [55c921a]``` but with some variation.\n"
">* At the end of the existing text, add ```; mailto:address@library.edu```, using your own email address. The full User-Agent field should now be similar to ```OpenRefine 3.2 [55c921a]; mailto:address@library.edu``` but reflect your version information and email address.\n"
">\n"
">The syntax for requesting journal information from CrossRef is ```http://api.crossref.org/journals/{ISSN}``` where {ISSN} is replaced with the ISSN of the journal\n"
">\n"
">* In the expression box type the GREL ```\"https://api.crossref.org/journals/\"+value```\n"
">* Click 'OK'\n"
">\n"
">You should see a message at the top on the OpenRefine screen indicating it is fetching some data, and how far it has got. Wait for this to complete. Fetching data for a single row should take only ten seconds or so, but fetching data for all rows will take longer. You can speed this up by modifying the \"Throttle Delay\" setting in the 'Add column by fetching URLs' dialog which controls the delay between each URL request made by OpenRefine. This is defaulted to a rather large 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).\n"
">\n"
">At this point you should have a new cell containing a long text string in a format called 'JSON' (this stands for JavaScript Object Notation, although very rarely spelt out in full).\n"
">\n"
">OpenRefine has a function for extracting data from JSON (sometimes referred to as 'parsing' the JSON). The 'parseJson' function is explained in more detail at [https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GREL-Other-Functions](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GREL-Other-Functions).\n"
">\n"
">* In the new column you've just added use the dropdown menu to access 'Edit column->Add column based on this column'\n"
">* Add a name for the new column e.g. \"Journal Title\"\n"
">* In the Expression box type the GREL ```value.parseJson().message.title```\n"
">* You should see in the Preview the Journal title displays\n"
">\n"
">The reason for using 'Add column based on this column' is simply that this allows you to retain the full JSON and extract further data from it if you need to. If you only wanted the title and did not need any other information from the JSON you could use 'Edit cells->Transform...' with the same GREL expression."

">Once you have chosen which service you are going to use:\n"
">\n"
">* In the Publisher column use the dropdown menu to choose 'Reconcile->Start Reconciling'\n"

">* Click on this to choose to use this reconciliation service\n"
">* In the middle box in the reconciliation dialogue you may get asked what type of 'entity' you want to reconcile to - that is, what type of thing are you looking for. The list will vary depending on what reconciliation service you are using.\n"
">    * In this case choose \"Corporate Name\" (it seems like the VIAF Reconciliation Service is slightly intelligent about this and will only offer options that are relevant)\n"
">* In the box on the righthand side of the reconciliation dialogue you can choose if other columns are used to help the reconciliation service make a match - however it is sometimes hard to tell what use (if any) the reconciliation service makes of these additional columns\n"
">* At the bottom of the reconciliation dialogue there is the option to \"Auto-match candidates with high confidence\". This can be a time saver, but in this case you are going to uncheck it, so you can see the results before a match is made\n"
">* Now click 'Start Reconciling'\n"

">\n"
">We could do these one by one, but if we are confident with the matches, there is an option to accept all:\n"
">\n"
">* Remove all filters/facets from the project so all rows display\n"
">* In the Publisher column use the dropdown menu to choose 'Reconcile->Actions->Match each cell to its best candidate'\n"
">\n"
">There are two things that reconciliation can do for you. Firstly it gets a standard form of the name or label for the entity. Secondly it gets an ID for the entity - in this case a VIAF id. This is hidden in the default view, but can be extracted:\n"
">\n"

"Notes:\n"
"* When you download OpenRefine for Windows or Linux from the address above, you are downloading a zip file. To install OpenRefine you unzip the downloaded file wherever you want to install the program. This can be to a personal directory or to an applications or software directory - OpenRefine should run wherever you put the unzipped folder. The location has to be a \"local\" drive as problems have been reported trying to run OpenRefine from a Network drive.\n"
"* OpenRefine is a Java application, and you need to have a 'Java Runtime Environment' (JRE) installed on your computer to run OpenRefine. If you don’t already have one installed then you can download and install from [http://java.com](http://java.com) by going to the site and clicking \"Free Java Download\".\n"
