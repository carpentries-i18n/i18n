">\n"
"> In mathematics, a [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Dynamical_system) is a system\n"
"> in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a "
"geometrical space. A canonical\n"
"> example of a dynamical system is the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Logistic_map),\n"
"> a growth model that computes a new population density (between  0 and 1) "
"based on the current\n"
"> density. In the model, time takes discrete values 0, 1, 2, ...\n"
">\n"
"> 1. Define a function called `logistic_map` that takes two inputs: `x`, "
"representing the current\n"
">    population (at time _t_), and a parameter `r=1`. This function should "
"return a value \n"
">    representing the state of the system (population) at time _t_+1, using "
"the mapping function \n"
">\n"
">    x(t+1) = r * x(t) * [1 - x(t)]\n"
">\n"
"> 2. Using a `for` or `while` loop, iterate the `logistic_map` function "
"defined in part 1, starting\n"
">    from an initial population of 0.5, for a period of time `t_final=10`. "
"Store the intermediate\n"
">    results in a list so that after the loop terminates you have "
"accumulated a sequence of values\n"
">    representing the state of the logistic map at times _t_=0,1,...,"
"_t_final_. Print this list to\n"
">    see the evolution of the population.\n"
">\n"
"> 3. Encapsulate the logic of your loop into a function called `iterate` "
"that takes the initial\n"
">    population as its first input, the parameter `t_final` as its second "
"input and the parameter\n"
">    `r` as its third input. The function should return the list of values "
"representing the state of\n"
">    the logistic map at times _t_=0,1,...,_t_final_. Run this function for "
"periods `t_final=100`\n"
