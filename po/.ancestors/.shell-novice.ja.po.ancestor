"> Some computers include a default Unix Shell program. \n"
"> The steps below describe some methods for identifying and opening a Unix Shell program if you already have one installed. \n"
"> There are also options for identifying and downloading a Unix Shell program, a Linux/UNIX emulator, or a program to access a UNIX server. \n"
">\n"
"> If none of the options below address your circumstances, try an online search for: UNIX shell [your computer model] [your operating system].\n"
">\n"
"> ### Linux\n"
"> The default shell for Linux operating systems is usually Bash.\n"
"> On most versions of Linux, it is accessible by running the Terminal program,\n"
">  which can be found via the applications menu or the search bar.  \n"
"> If your machine is set up to use something other than bash, you can run it by opening a terminal and typing `bash`.\n"
">\n"
"> ### Mac OS\n"
"> For a Mac computer, the default Unix Shell is Bash,\n"
"> and it is available via the Terminal Utilities program within your Applications folder.\n"
">\n"
"> To open Terminal, try one or both of the following:\n"
"> * Go to your Applications. Within Applications, open the Utilities folder. Locate Terminal in the Utilities folder and open it.\n"
"> * Use the Mac ‘Spotlight’ computer search function. Search for: Terminal and press [Enter] - this will open Terminal.\n"

"> ### Windows\n"
"> Computers with Windows operating systems do not automatically have a Unix Shell program installed.\n"
"> In this lesson, we encourage you to use an emulator included in Git for Windows, \n"
"> which gives you access to both Bash shell commands and Git. \n"
"> If you are attending a SWC session, it is likely you have already received instructions on how to install Git for Windows.\n"
">\n"
"> Once installed, you can open a terminal by running the program Git Bash from the Windows start menu.\n"
">\n"
"> Other solutions are available for running Bash commands on Windows systems. \n"
"> There is now a Bash shell command-line tool available for Windows 10. \n"
"> Additionally, you can run Bash commands on a remote UNIX computer or server from your Windows machine. \n"
"> This can be done through a Secure Shell (SSH) client. \n"
"> One such client available for free for Windows computers is PuTTY. \n"
"> See the reference below for information on installing and using PuTTY, \n"
"> using the Windows 10 command-line tool, or installing and using a UNIX/Linux emulator.\n"
