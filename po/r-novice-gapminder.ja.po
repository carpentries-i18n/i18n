"> > 3. `as.numeric(human_age)` yields `1 2 3 4 4` because factors are stored as integers (here, 1:4), each of which is associated with a label (here, 28, 35, 56, and 63). Converting the factor to a numeric vector gives us the underlying integers, not the labels. If we want the original numbers, we need to convert `human_age` to a character vector and then to a numeric vector (why does this work?). This comes up in real life when we accidentally include a character somewhere in a column of a .csv file supposed to only contain numbers, and forget to set `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` when we read in the data."

"> > 3. `as.numeric(human_age)` からは、`1 2 3 4 4` が返ってきます。なぜなら、順序なし文字型は、それぞれが、ラベル（ここでは、28、35、56、63）に紐づけられた整数型（ここでは、1:4）として蓄積されているからです。順序なし文字型を数値型に変換する際は、ラベルの値ではなく、裏にある整数に変換されるのです。もとの数が欲しい場合は、`human_age`を文字ベクトルにしてから、数値ベクトルにする必要があります（なぜこれでうまくいくのでしょう？）。この問題は、csvファイルの中で数だけを持つはずの列のどこかにうっかり文字を入れてしまい、データを読み込むとき`stringsAsFactors=FALSE`を設定し忘れてしまったときなどに起こります。"

">  * `|`, the \"logical OR\" operator: returns `TRUE`, if either the left or right\n"
">    (or both) are `TRUE`.\n"

">\n"
">  * `!`, the \"logical NOT\" operator: converts `TRUE` to `FALSE` and `FALSE` to\n"
">    `TRUE`. It can negate a single logical condition (eg `!TRUE` becomes\n"
">    `FALSE`), or a whole vector of conditions(eg `!c(TRUE, FALSE)` becomes\n"
">    `c(FALSE, TRUE)`).\n"
">\n"
"> Additionally, you can compare the elements within a single vector using the\n"
"> `all` function (which returns `TRUE` if every element of the vector is `TRUE`)\n"
"> and the `any` function (which returns `TRUE` if one or more elements of the\n"
