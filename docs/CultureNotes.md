# Culture Notes for Japanese lessons

- non-literal translation are ok (for example characters Japanese people may 
  not know)

- please document them here to ensure that we are consistent throughout lessons

- if you have a suggestion please discuss it as an issue on GitHub 

- Give Gregorian calendar dates in the order year, month, day, and following
  typical Japanese usage, use ``yyyy.mm.dd`` over the ISO standard using
  ``yyyy-mm-dd``.

- Avoid dates using the Japanese era name (年号, nengou),
  e.g. 2018 is "Heisei 30".
