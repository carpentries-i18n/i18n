# Rules of conduct

* Please do not remove the files for other languages (currently Spanish) from
the repository.
These need to be retained to merge the lessons with the main i18n repository
and existing lessons.

* Please do not delete the archived files for translation of previous versions 
of the English lessons.
  These will be needed to merge translations with updated English files
for future releases of the main Software Carpentry lessons.
This means that we will only need to translate updated sections and
  translations to sections that have not been updated will be migrated to 
new releases.

* Please only submit changes specific to Japanese language translations to this
 repository as Pull Requests.
 Please submit issues specific to the English lessons to the main
lesson repository. If you have a suggestion
 for a change to the content or examples, we cannot change these in the
Japanese lesson and the main lessons need to be updated in English.
We ask that these changes be raised as an Issue in Japanese rather than a
 Pull Request if you prefer not to submit an Issue or Pull Request in English.

* Please contact us if you wish to join the core translation team.
Any contributions to the Japanese lessons are welcome as Pull Requests
but please make sure you understand the English version of the lesson if
 you are able to.

* Please commit and push changes to a fork of the repository on your personal
GitHub account and submit a Pull Request. In this way, suggested changes can be
reviewed and discussed. Please raise any matters that you are unsure of or want
help with when submitting a Pull Request.

* Please track changes to all files needed to generate the translated lessons. 
This way we can combine all changes from contributors and track our progress.
All contributions will be attributed to each contributor.

* Please contact us via an Issue if anything is unclear in the guides to set up
 or use the  translation tools in this repository so we can update the
 README and guides.

* Please commit often and discuss issues on github to ensure that we are not
  repeating each other.

* Add your name to the translation team if you wish (unless you want
  to remain anonymous).
