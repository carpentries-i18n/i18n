msgid "It's all right not to get through the whole lesson.\n"
":   This lesson is designed for people who have never programmed before,\n"
"    but any given class may include people with a wide range of prior experience.\n"
"    We have therefore included enough material to fill a full day if need be,\n"
"    but expect that many offerings will only get as far as the introduction to Pandas."

":   One of the goals of this lesson is\n"
"    to help novices build a workable mental model of how programming works.\n"
"    Until they have that model,\n"
"    they will not know what to search for or how to recognize a helpful answer.\n"
"    Telling them to Google can also give the impression that we think their problem is trivial.\n"
"    (That said, if learners have done enough programming before to be past these issues,\n"
"    having them search for solutions online can help them solidify their understanding.)\n"
"    It's also worth quoting\n"

"    comment about online search:\n"
"    \"If you find anything,\n"
"    other folks were confused enough to bother with a blog or Stack Overflow post,\n"
"    so it's probably not trivial.\""
