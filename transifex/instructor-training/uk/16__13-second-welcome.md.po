"Yesterday we focused on general aspects of educational psychology and pedagogy and\n"
"how to create a positive classroom as environment, addressing the first two goals.\n"
"We started to address the third goal by discussing the importance of lesson study\n"
"and observation, and by providing an opportunity to teach and\n"
"receive feedback. We will continue that skill development process today, as we\n"
"focus on the specifics of teaching Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry workshops.\n"
"We will review specific\n"
"teaching practices we follow at our workshops and practice using some of them. One of the most important practices\n"
"in the Carpentries is participatory live coding.  We'll spend some time practicing this skill for multiple reasons:\n"
"one, you rarely find this approach in a current university setting so it's good\n"
"to try it out, but also, this will give us a chance to continue developing skills\n"
"we discussed yesterday that help improve our teaching: reflective practice and\n"
"providing (and receiving!) constructive feedback. Finally, we will conclude our training with a discussion about workshop logistics that will help you in preparing to teach your first workshop and become involved in the Carpentries community."
