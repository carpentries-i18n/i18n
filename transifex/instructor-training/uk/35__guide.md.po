"  - Announce *at the beginning* of the training that all participants should mute when\n"
"  they are not talking.  You may need to repeat this a few times during the early part\n"
"  of the training, until people are doing it consistently.  \n"
"  - In general, it works best to have everyone use zoom individually on their computers\n"
"  (so you can see everyone's faces); for trainings where some of the participants are\n"
"  co-located, have them use their own computer for video but pick one person to use\n"
"  for mic/sound.  \n"
"  - “Gallery view” in the upper right toggles the display to show more participants' videos.  \n"
"  - “Share screen” is at the bottom middle of the screen. To end “share screen”, click the red button that will appear at the top middle of the screen when you are in screen sharing mode.  \n"
"  - When you screen share, you have the option to share individual apps or your entire desktop. The default is the full desktop.\n"
"  - The Zoom chat is not stable (it is not saved across sessions or after going into breakout rooms, and people who have just joined a room can't see previously posted chat items). We highly recommend using the Etherpad or Google Doc chat instead. For those who want to save the chat, they do that using the \"More\" option in the chat window, which offers \"Save chat\". Choosing this will save the chat to a local text file on the person's computer.\n"
"  - During breaks, learners will often turn off their video and wait for your audio cue to re-activate. This makes it look like no one is back from break, but just saying 'hello' will generally get a bunch of people to come back on video quickly.\n"
"  - When several attendees are in the same room (member trainings): it is helpful to have every participant log in separately so that you can see names and faces and they can interact by waving or using the chat. However, it is important that only one microphone and speaker should be active in the room at one time or feedback and noise will be a problem. When creating breakouts, you can either leave these people in the main room or shuffle people around to create a room just for them. Either way, ask them to leave a mic on so you can listen in.\n"
"  - Attendees might like to have a separate room (without Trainers) to network in over lunch or other breaks. Be prepared to assign that room and then close it to restart the main session.\n"
"  - when you are in the Zoom meeting room but unintentionally not as the host, look for the button 'Claim host' (click on the 'Participants' button; you'll be asked for a 6-digit host key, which you can find (after logging in to [Zoom][zoom-home]), at the bottom of the profile, see [the explanation here][zoom-host-key]."

"Suggested points to make during introductions:\n"
"* This is not a high-stakes test! This is a friendly opportunity to give and receive feedback. On occasion, we do invite \n"
"people to return for a second try. If we do this, your follow-up email will contain very clear instructions on exactly what\n"
"we'd like you to change on your next visit. This does not mean we don't want you as an instructor, it means we want you to be\n"
"ready to put your best foot forward in the classroom and we are here to help you do that. (KW)\n"
"* I will not tell anyone that they have passed or ask anyone to repeat during this session. That information will come in the follow up email. (KW)\n"
"* The feedback you give sometimes says as much or more about your approach to instruction as the demo itself. (KW)\n"
"* Have trainees introduce themselves (name and institution or location) at the start. This makes sure everyone knows where the \n"
"mute button is. (EB)\n"
"* I have already determined a random order for you each to do your demonstration. When it's your turn, I will tell you what\n"
"episode you will be teaching from, and\n"
"you will have a minute or two to set up your screen. You will screen share (describe where the button is) and will have the \n"
"option to share your whole Desktop or just a single application. I recommend sharing only the application you will be teaching\n"
"from, that way you can keep your notes up on your screen without us seeing them. It's perfectly fine to teach using your\n"
"notes - that's how I always teach. (EB)\n"
"* When your time is up, I will stop you and ask you to give feedback on yourself and then ask others to add their feedback. (EB)"

"Different ways of managing feedback during the demo:\n"
"* Create your own etherpad and populate it with episode links, feedback templates, whatever. \n"
"* Use +/- content delivery rubric. (Or use \"improvement\" in place of \"-\" as suggested by MC). Keep in mind that some learners\n"
"(like some Trainers) do not have the content expertise to be able to fully evaluate that category for all lessons.\n"
"* If there is time (4 people or less) you can do feedback entirely verbally, or have them issue verbal feedback after writing \n"
"notes in the etherpad. If you do this, suggest having presenter give their own feedback, then other learners, then Trainer can\n"
"summarize/disagree/add/emphasize as needed.\n"
"* I take notes on physical paper during each demo with points I think need to be made, then mark things off as others\n"
"mention them in their feedback. Usually, the trainees catch most of the things I wanted to mention, and I can choose just\n"
"one or two things to comment on. (EB)"
