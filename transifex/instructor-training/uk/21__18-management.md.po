">\n"
">> ## Recommendations\n"
">>\n"
">> If you and a partner are co-teaching, try to follow these recommendations:\n"
">>\n"
">>- Coordinate who is teaching what, sufficiently in advance that\n"
">>  both instructors are confident in their preparation.\n"
">>\n"
">>- If you have time to do some\n"
">>  advance preparation together, try drawing a concept map together or\n"
">>  teaching a short snippet of the lessons for each other.\n"
">>\n"
">>- Discuss in advance if you will providing feedback to each other\n"
">>  and how to do so (see notes above).\n"
">>\n"
">>- If it won't cause cognitive overload for you (the instructors),\n"
">>  work out a couple of hand signals to communicate.  \"You're\n"
">>  going too fast\", \"speak up\", \"that learner needs help\", and, \"It's\n"
">>  time for a bathroom break\" are all useful.\n"
">>\n"
">>- The person who isn't teaching shouldn't interrupt, offer\n"
">>  corrections, elaborations, or amusing personal anecdotes, or do\n"
">>  anything else to distract from what the person teaching at the time\n"
">>  is doing or saying.  The one exception is that it's sometimes\n"
">>  helpful to ask leading questions, particularly if the learners seem\n"
">>  unsure of themselves.\n"
">>\n"
">>- For Carpentries workshops, a single instructor usually teaches for a\n"
">>  half-day stretch (2-3 hours).  You can alternate more frequently, but\n"
">>  each person should teach for at least 10-15 minutes at a stretch,\n"
">>  since learners may be distracted by more frequent interleaving.\n"
">>\n"
">>- Each person should take a couple of minutes before they start\n"
">>  teaching to see what their partner is going to teach after they're\n"
">>  done.  This allows each instructor to set up their partner's material\n"
">>  without covering it themselves.\n"
">>\n"
">>- Whenever possible, the person who isn't teaching should stay engaged\n"
">>  with the class.  Monitor the shared notes, keep an eye\n"
">>  on the learners to see who's struggling, jot down some feedback to\n"
">>  give your teaching partner at the next break - anything that\n"
">>  contributes to the lesson is better than anything that doesn't.  It's\n"
">>  easier for the other instructor to take a break to catch up on outside\n"
">>  work (like email) if there are at least\n"
">>  three instructors or sufficient helpers to make sure that the main\n"
">>  instructor is supported."
