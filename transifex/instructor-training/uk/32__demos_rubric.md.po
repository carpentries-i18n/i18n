Deciding whether a particular trainee passes or fails the demonstration is the sole discretion of the\n"

Trainees who have three or more marks in the \"Negative\" columns below should probably be asked to try again. Even one \n"
"mark in a \"Negative\" column can be considered justification for asking a trainee to redo their demonstration if the problem is significant. As always,\n"
"Trainers should use their own judgement when applying this rubric in individual cases.  "
