msgid "The second big question for groups that want to open up their work is where to\n"
"host their code and data.  One option is for the lab, the department, or the\n"
"university to provide a server, manage accounts and backups, and so on.  The\n"
"main benefit of this is that it clarifies who owns what, which is particularly\n"
"important if any of the material is sensitive (i.e., relates to experiments\n"
"involving human subjects or may be used in a patent application).  The main\n"
"drawbacks are the cost of providing the service and its longevity: a scientist\n"
"who has spent ten years collecting data would like to be sure that data will\n"
"still be available ten years from now, but that's well beyond the lifespan of\n"
"most of the grants that fund academic infrastructure."

msgid "Another option is to purchase a domain and pay an Internet service provider\n"
"(ISP) to host it.  This gives the individual or group more control, and\n"
"sidesteps problems that can arise when moving from one institution to another,\n"
"but requires more time and effort to set up than either the option above or the\n"
"option below."

msgid "The third option is to use a public hosting service like\n"
"[GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com),or\n"
"[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org).\n"
"Each of these services provides a web interface that enables people to create,\n"
"view, and edit their code repositories.  These services also provide\n"
"communication and project management tools including issue tracking, wiki pages,\n"
"email notifications, and code reviews.  These services benefit from economies of\n"
"scale and network effects: it's easier to run one large service well than to run\n"
"many smaller services to the same standard.  It's also easier for people to\n"
"collaborate.  Using a popular service can help connect your project with\n"
"communities already using the same service."

"of powerful tools.  One such tool, continuous integration (CI), can\n"
"automatically run software builds and tests whenever code is committed or pull\n"
"requests are submitted.  Direct integration of CI with an online hosting service\n"
"means this information is present in any pull request, and helps maintain code\n"
"integrity and quality standards.  While CI is still available in self-hosted\n"
"situations, there is much less setup and maintenance involved with using an\n"
"online service.  Furthermore, such tools are often provided free of charge to\n"
"open source projects, and are also available for private repositories for a fee."
