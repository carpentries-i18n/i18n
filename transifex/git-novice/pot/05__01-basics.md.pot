"> Automated version control systems are nothing new.\n"
"> Tools like [RCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System), [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), or [Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) have been around since the early 1980s and are used by \n"
"> many large companies.\n"
"> However, many of these are now considered legacy systems (i.e., outdated) due to various \n"
"> limitations in their capabilities.\n"
"> More modern systems, such as Git and [Mercurial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/hg-novice/),\n"
"> are *distributed*, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository.\n"
"> These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for \n"
"> multiple authors to work on\n"
"> the same files concurrently."
