"questions:\n"
"- \"How do I record changes in Git?\"\n"
"- \"How do I check the status of my version control repository?\"\n"
"- \"How do I record notes about what changes I made and why?\"\n"
"objectives:\n"
"- \"Go through the modify-add-commit cycle for one or more files.\"\n"
"- \"Explain where information is stored at each stage of that cycle.\"\n"
"- \"Distinguish between descriptive and non-descriptive commit messages.\"\n"
"keypoints:\n"
"- \"`git status` shows the status of a repository.\"\n"
"- \"Files can be stored in a project's working directory (which users see), the staging area (where the next commit is being built up) and the local repository (where commits are permanently recorded).\"\n"
"- \"`git add` puts files in the staging area.\"\n"
"- \"`git commit` saves the staged content as a new commit in the local repository.\"\n"
"- \"Write a commit message that accurately describes your changes.\"\n"

"> Two important facts you should know about directories in Git.\n"
">\n"
"> 1. Git does not track directories on their own, only files within them.\n"
">    Try it for yourself:\n"
">\n"
">    ~~~\n"
">    $ mkdir spaceships\n"
">    $ git status\n"
">    $ git add spaceships\n"
">    $ git status\n"
">    ~~~\n"
">    {: .language-bash}\n"
">\n"
">    Note, our newly created empty directory `spaceships` does not appear in\n"
">    the list of untracked files even if we explicitly add it (_via_ `git add`) to our\n"
">    repository. This is the reason why you will sometimes see `.gitkeep` files\n"
">    in otherwise empty directories. Unlike `.gitignore`, these files are not special\n"
">    and their sole purpose is to populate a directory so that Git adds it to\n"
">    the repository. In fact, you can name such files anything you like.\n"
">\n"
"> 2. If you create a directory in your Git repository and populate it with files,\n"
">    you can add all files in the directory at once by:\n"
">\n"
">    ~~~\n"
">    git add <directory-with-files>\n"
">    ~~~\n"
">    {: .language-bash}\n"
">\n"
">    Try it for yourself:\n"
">\n"
">    ~~~\n"
">    $ touch spaceships/apollo-11 spaceships/sputnik-1\n"
">    $ git status\n"
">    $ git add spaceships\n"
">    $ git status\n"
">    ~~~\n"
">    {: .language-bash}\n"
">\n"
">    Before moving on, we will commit these changes.\n"
