"> ### Find your Git Executable\n"
">\n"
"> First let's make sure that Git is installed on your computer.\n"

"> - `which git` (macOS, Linux)\n"

"> and type `which git` (macOS, Linux), or `where git` (Windows).\n"
"> Copy the path to the git executable.\n"
">\n"
"> On one Windows computer which had GitHub Desktop installed on it, the path was:\n"
"> `C:/Users/UserName/AppData/Local/GitHubDesktop/app-1.1.1/resources/app/git/cmd/git.exe`\n"
">\n"
"> NOTE: The path on your computer will be somewhat different.\n"
">\n"
"> ### Tell RStudio where to find GitHub\n"
">\n"
"> In RStudio, go to the `Tools` menu > `Global Options` > `Git/SVN` and then\n"
"> browse to the Git executable you found in the command prompt or shell. Now restart\n"
"> RStudio.\n"
"> Note: Even if you have Git installed, you may need\n"
"> to accept the Xcode license if you are using macOS."
