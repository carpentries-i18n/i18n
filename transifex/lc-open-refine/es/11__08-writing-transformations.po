msgid "To start writing transformations, select the column on which you wish to perform a transformation and choose ```Edit cells->Transformâ€¦```. In the screen that displays you have a place to write a transformation (the 'Expression' box) and then the ability to Preview the effect the transformation would have on 10 rows of your data."
