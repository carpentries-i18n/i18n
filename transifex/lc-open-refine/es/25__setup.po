"Notes:\n"
"* When you download OpenRefine for Windows or Linux from the address above, "
"you are downloading an archive file \n"
"(zip or tar). To install OpenRefine unzip the downloaded file to a permanent "
"location on your computer. This can \n"
"be to a personal directory or to an applications or software directory - "
"OpenRefine should run wherever you put the\n"
"unzipped folder. The location has to be a \"local\" drive as problems have "
"been reported trying to run OpenRefine\n"
"from a Network drive.\n"
"* The options \"Windows kit with embedded Java\" and \"Mac kit\" include "
"Java as part of the package. You **do not**\n"
"need to install Java if you use one of these kits. This is the preferred "
"method on Windows and Mac systems.\n"
"* On Windows, if you use the traditional \"Windows kit\" without embedded "
"Java, you will need a \n"
"\"Java Runtime Environment\" (JRE) on your system. If you do not already "
"have JRE or JDK installed, \n"
"you can visit [Adopt OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle Java]"
"(https://java.com/en/download/) \n"
"to download an installer package. Please note that\n"
"[Oracle significantly changed their license terms in 2019](https://www."
"oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk-faqs.html) limiting it to \"personal "
"use\" with out a paid license. If you use OpenRefine at work or in research, "
"OpenJDK is preferred.\n"
"* On Linux a \"Java Runtime Environment\" (JRE) will be required to run "
"OpenRefine. If you do not already have \n"
"JRE or JDK installed on your system, most distribution repositories will "
"contain OpenJRE / OpenJDK packages. I\n"
"nstall the default version available from your distribution. For example, on "
"Ubuntu/Debian: \n"
"`sudo apt install default-jre`.\n"
"* OpenRefine does not support Internet Explorer. Please use [Firefox]"
"(https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/), \n"
"[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/"
"safari/) instead."
