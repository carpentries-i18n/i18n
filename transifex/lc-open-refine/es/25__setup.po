"Notes:\n"
"* When you download OpenRefine for Windows or Linux from the address above, you are downloading a zip file. To install OpenRefine you unzip the downloaded file wherever you want to install the program. This can be to a personal directory or to an applications or software directory - OpenRefine should run wherever you put the unzipped folder. The location has to be a \"local\" drive as problems have been reported trying to run OpenRefine from a Network drive.\n"
"* OpenRefine is a Java application, and you need to have a 'Java Runtime Environment' (JRE) installed on your computer to run OpenRefine. If you donâ€™t already have one installed then you can download and install from [http://java.com](http://java.com) by going to the site and clicking \"Free Java Download\".\n"
"* OpenRefine does not support Internet Explorer or Edge. Please use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) instead."
