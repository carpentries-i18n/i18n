" OpenRefine is a desktop application that uses your web browser as a "
"graphical interface. It is described as \"a power tool for working with "
"messy data\" ([David "
"Huynh](http://web.archive.org/web/20141021040915/http://davidhuynh.net/spaces/nicar2011/tutorial.pdf))"
" - but what does this mean? It is probably easiest to describe the kinds of "
"data OpenRefine is good at working with and the sorts of problems it can "
"help you or your team solve."

"OpenRefine is most useful where you have data in a simple tabular format "
"such as a spreadsheet, a comma separated values file (csv) or a tab "
"delimited file (tsv) but with internal inconsistencies either in data "
"formats, or where data appears, or in terminology used. OpenRefine can be "
"used to standardize and clean data across your file. It can help you:"
