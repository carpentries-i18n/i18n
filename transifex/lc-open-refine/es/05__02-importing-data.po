">## Create your first OpenRefine project (using provided data)\n"
">\n"
"> To import the data for the exercise below, follow the instructions in "
"[Setup](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-open-refine/setup.html) to "
"download the data and run OpenRefine. *NOTE: If OpenRefine does not open in "
"a browser window, open your browser and type the address "
"<http://127.0.0.1:3333/> to take you to the OpenRefine interface.*\n"
">\n"
">1. Once OpenRefine is launched in your browser, click `Create Project` from "
"the left hand menu and select `Get data from This Computer`\n"
">2. Click `Choose Files` (or 'Browse', depending on your setup) and locate "
"the file which you have downloaded called `doaj-article-sample.csv`\n"
">3. Click `Next >>` - the next screen (see below) gives you options to "
"ensure the data is imported into OpenRefine correctly. The options vary "
"depending on the type of data you are importing.\n"
">4. Click in the `Character encoding` box and set it to `UTF-8`. This "
"ensures that OpenRefine correctly interprets the imported data as UTF-8 "
"encoded. If you don't select this you may find that some special characters "
"(e.g. smart quotation marks) are not displayed correctly.\n"
">5. Ensure the first row is used to create the column headings by checking "
"the box `Parse next 1 line(s) as column headers`\n"
">6. OpenRefine will automatically select \"Use character\" to enclose cells "
"containing column separators as this will place data in one cell where the "
"values are enclosed in quotes from the source dataset\n"
">7. From OpenRefine 3.4 onwards there is an option to Trim leading & "
"trailing whitespace from strings when importing separator-based files. "
"Keeping this checked will ensure that values like `English` and `English `, "
"which differ by a single trailing space, are not treated as different values "
"after the import\n"
">8. Make sure the `Parse cell text into numbers, dates, ...` box is not "
"checked, so OpenRefine doesn't try to automatically detect numbers as it may "
"cause errors such as confusion between date formats (e.g. DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/"
"DD/YYYY)\n"
">9. The Project Name box in the upper right corner will default to the title "
"of your imported file. Click in the `Project Name` box to give your project "
"a different name, if desired.\n"
">10. Once you are happy click the `Create Project >>` button at the top "
"right of the screen. This will create the project and open it for you. "
"Projects are saved as you work on them, there is no need to save copies as "
"you go along.\n"
