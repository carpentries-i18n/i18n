msgid "Through facets, filters and clusters OpenRefine offers relatively straightforward ways of getting an overview of your data, and making changes where you want to standardise terms used to a common set of values."

#: lc-open-refine/_episodes/07-introduction-to-transformations.md:20
msgid "However, sometimes there will be changes you want to make to the data that cannot be achieved in this way. Such types of changes include:"

# unordered list

msgid "* Splitting data that is in a single column into multiple columns (e.g. splitting an address into multiple parts)"

# unordered list

msgid "* Standardising the format of data in a column without changing the values (e.g. removing punctuation or standardising a date format)"

msgid "To support this type of activity OpenRefine supports 'Transformations' which are ways of manipulating data in columns. Transformations are normally written in a special language called 'GREL' (General Refine Expression Language). To some extent GREL expressions are similar to Excel Formula, although they tend to focus on text manipulations rather than numeric functions."

msgid "Full documentation for the GREL is available at [https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/grelfunctions](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/grelfunctions). This tutorial covers only a small subset of the commands available."

"Common Transformation  | Action | GREL expression\n"

"To Uppercase| Converts the current value to uppercase | ```value.toUppercase()```\n"
"To Lowercase| Converts the current value to lowercase | ```value.toLowercase()```\n"
"To Titlecase| Converts the current value to titlecase (i.e. each word starts with an uppercase character and all other characters are converted to lowercase) | ```value.toTitlecase()```\n"
"Trim leading and trailing whitespace | Removes any 'whitespace' characters (e.g. spaces, tabs) from the start or end of the current value | ```value.trim()```"

">## Correct Publisher data\n"
">1. Create a text facet on the Publisher column\n"
">2. Note that in the values there are two that look almost identical - why do these two values appear separately rather than as a single value?\n"
">3. On the publisher column use the dropdown menu to select ```Edit cells->Common transforms->Collapse consecutive whitespace```\n"
">4. Look at the publisher facet now - has it changed? (if it hasn't changed try clicking the ```Refresh``` option to make sure it updates)"
