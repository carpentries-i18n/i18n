"title: \"Layout of OpenRefine, Rows vs Records\"\n"
"teaching:  10\n"
"exercises: 5\n"
"questions:\n"
"- \"How is data organised in OpenRefine?\"\n"
"- \"How do I access options to amend data in OpenRefine?\"\n"
"- \"What is the difference between Rows and Records in OpenRefine?\"\n"
"- \"How do I work with single cells that contain multiple values in a list?\"\n"
"objectives:\n"
"- Locate controls for navigating data in OpenRefine\n"
"- Find options to work with data through the OpenRefine dropdown menus\n"
"- Split cells which contain multiple bits of data so that each piece of data is in its own cell\n"
"keypoints:\n"
"- \"OpenRefine uses rows and columns to display data\"\n"
"- \"Most options to work with data in OpenRefine are accessed through a drop down menu at the top of a data column\"\n"
"- \"When you select an option in a particular column (e.g. to make a change to the data), it will effect all the cells in that column\"\n"
"- \"OpenRefine has a Records mode which links together multiple rows into a single record\"\n"
"- \"Split and join multi-valued cells to modify the individual values within them\"\n"
"- \"When creating multi-valued cells in your data, choose a separator that will not appear in the data values\"\n"

"OpenRefine displays data in a tabular format. Each row will usually "
